# xapWebWallet
A web-based wallet made with PHP (Laravel), HTML, CSS, Javascript and jQuery for Apollon (XAP) coin

Edit the .env file's "XAPRPCIP", "XAPRPCPORT", "XAPRPCUSERNAME", and "XAPRPCPASSWORD" to whatever you have set for the wallet that you're connecting to. #letHerRip

If there are ANY security concerns please don't hesitate to mention them to me. I'd like to make this as secure as possible.

Additionally if there are any bug requests those are just as welcome (I may just not get around to them nearly as quickly, just being honest; I have a 9-5 too!)
